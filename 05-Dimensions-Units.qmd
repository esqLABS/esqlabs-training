## In PK-Sim and MoBi

PK-Sim uses the concept of Dimensions and Units

- A **dimension** represents the type of quantity (*e.g.* Volume, Mass, Concentration)
- A **unit** is one of several ways to measure a dimension (*e.g.* L, mL; Kg, g; mg/L, Âµg/mL)

The software uses a **base unit** for each dimension

- Volume in L,
- Mass is in kg,
- Concentration (molar) is in Âµmol/L

## {.center}

:::{.callout-note}
Even if the user can deviate from base unit, `PK-Sim` will always use the base unit internally
:::

:::{.callout-important}
The base units are often different from the units that are displayed by default in PK-Sim, these are called the **display units**

## In `{ospsuite}`

`{ospsuite}` uses the same concept of Dimensions and Units.
The package provides a set of functions for easy conversion between units of a same dimension.

- `toUnit()` to convert from one unit to another
- `toBaseUnit()` to convert from any unit to the base unit
- `toDisplayUnit()` to convert from the base unit to the display unit

```{r}
ospsuite::toUnit(quantityOrDimension = "Volume",values = 1,sourceUnit = "L", targetUnit = "mL")

ospsuite::toBaseUnit(quantityOrDimension = "Volume",values = 1000, unit = "mL")
```
